Introduction to Cybersecurity Virtual Experience Program

Welcome to the Commonwealth Bank Introduction to Cybersecurity Virtual Experience Program! We are so excited to have you here!

We’re building a courageous, trusting culture and supporting growth at pace. We believe Cyber is everyone’s business and invest in our people and communities to develop global Cyber capabilities. We’re part of Technology and are responsible for the world-leading applications across every single aspect of CommBank – from innovative product platforms for our customers, to essential tools within our business.

During this program, you will get the opportunity to step into the shoes of a Commonwealth Bank team member and complete tasks that replicate the work that our Cybersecurity team does every day. You’ll learn how to create and visually represent a reliable dataset, present your findings to stakeholders and respond to an incident as a cybersecurity analyst.

We hope this program provides a great resource for you to up-skill and strengthen your resume as you explore career options and a potential career at Commonwealth Bank!
